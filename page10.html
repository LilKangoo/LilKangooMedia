                <ul class="list mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    <li><strong>Q: Does your studio provide photography services?</strong><br></li><hr><li>A: Yes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Q: Does your studio provide videography services?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Yes.</li><li><strong>Q: Does your studio provide graphic design services?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Yes.</li><li><strong>Q: Does your studio provide marketing strategy services?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Yes. We deliver high resolution images, videos and help you with your online exposure. We also take over your social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and many others to create posts and content every day. For more information <a href="ContactUs.html" class="text-primary">contact us</a> directly.</li><li><strong>Q: Do you deliver every image you shoot?</strong></li><hr><li>A: No, we do not. We eliminate duplicate images, test shots, missed focused shots, shots with bad expressions and other images that may dilute the overall product delivery. For example, because we shoot with low apertures, sometimes we take a few extra shots to make sure we have the perfect focus. We don’t expect you to have the expertise or the time to zoom into each image to select the one with the sharpest focus, so we spend hours doing that on our end. In another example, candid laughs and emotional tears are some of the best images from the day. Unfortunately, they can also yield some unflattering facial expressions. We might snap a few extras of any of these moments to make sure we have a great shot with the ideal expression for the moment. With our expertise of processing millions of images each year, we may eliminate ones that we feel are duplicates and only deliver the best one.</li><li><strong>Q: What if you haven’t shot at my venue before?</strong></li><hr><li>A: We will get to the venue early on the day of the shoot be sure to perform a thorough walk-through to scout out the best photography/videography locations. We also do extensive online research prior to your big day.</li><li><strong>Q: Do you do destination shooting? What additional fees are associated with destination shoots?</strong></li><hr><li>A: While LilKangooMedia is based in Cyprus, we serve clients all around the world. Our destination photography/videography packages include the cost of travel and reasonable accommodations if needed. <a href="ContactUs.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Contact us</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Q: Does your studio do headshots, individual portraits, family portraits, newborn shoots, commercial photography/videography, or other types of photography/videography?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Yes, we have experience in many fields of photography and videography. Feel free to&nbsp;<a href="ContactUs.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank">contact us</a>&nbsp;for more information.</li><li><strong>Q: What do you mean by “touching up” the photos?</strong></li><hr><li>A: “Touching up” in our studio is the same as our signature (standard) post-production. See the question below for clarification.</li><li><strong> Q: Do you touch up all the images in our image download?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Yes we do. Every image we deliver is post produced with our unique signature style of post-production. This involves colour correction, exposure adjustment, selective black and white processing, clarity adjustments, tone-mapping, and other corrections. Many photographers will not post produce any images, or will only post produce “select” images from your shoot. This means that you may have pictures that are too dark, have strange skin tones or other common photography flaws.</li><li><strong>Q: What is the difference between advanced and custom; and why are there additional costs for a custom retouch?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Advanced post-production includes touch-ups such as removal of blemishes, removal of bags under eyes, removal of fly-away hairs, etc. On the other hand, custom post production is anything that requires extensive, custom work in Photoshop such as removing entire objects from the scene, changing the size and shape of body parts or other objects in the scene, adding objects to a scene and other custom work. We charge hourly for the custom post-production as the time required ranges depending on the complexity of the project. Please <a href="ContactUs.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank">contact our studio</a> manager for a quote for custom post-production.</li><li><strong>Q: Do you shoot in JPEG, Small Raw, or Large Raw?</strong></li><hr><li>A: We shoot most of our images in Large Raw.</li><li><strong>Q: How many images do you typically deliver?</strong></li><hr><li>A: We typically deliver anywhere from 60-100 images per 3-hour individual photoshoot and for an event,&nbsp;we typically deliver 60-80 images per hour. Keep in mind these numbers may increase or decrease depending on the flow of the day and the number of events/activities needing to be captured.</li><li><strong>Q: When and where can we view our pictures/videos/designs?</strong></li><hr><li> A: Your images/videos/designs will be completed no more than 3 weeks after the date of the shoot. If you require the images to be completed prior to 3 weeks after the date of your shoot, a rush edit fee of €100 will be charged.</li><li><strong>Q: How long does it take to get my prints?</strong></li><hr><li>Product creation times vary, however, print orders will generally be completed within 3 weeks after the product order is submitted. Similar to the post-production process, if you require rush processing, a fee of €100.00 will be charged. Additional fees for rush shipping may also apply.</li><li><strong>Q: What rights do I have to the digital prints/videos/designs?</strong></li><hr><li>A: You have the right to reprint images whenever you want. However, you may not sell your images for profit or publish your images without the written consent of LilKangooMedia.</li><li><strong> Q: Do you provide the RAW files from a shoot?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Each of our packages comes with a full resolution image download. However, we typically do not provide RAW (unprocessed) files from our shoots because we believe in delivering a finished product. In fact, we’re often shooting with the end (post-produced) product in mind. However, on occasion, we may provide RAW images along with our post-produced JPG’s for an additional fee and restrictions.</li><li><strong>Q: What if I lose my images?</strong></li><hr><li>A: There is a €100 replacement charge for additional downloads after the event has been archived. We strongly suggest you make at least one copy of the download when you receive it from us.</li><li><strong>Q: How do I reserve you for a photoshoot/video/design?</strong></li><hr><li>A: All dates are reserved once we receive your signed contract and deposit. <a href="ContactUs.html" class="text-primary">Klick here</a> to contact us for get a quote.</li><li><strong>Q: What if we exceed our contracted time for our photoshoot/video-shoot?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Standard rates apply for overtime.</li><li>€150/hour per Master Photographer, €100/hour per Associate Photographer and €70/hour per photographer assistant.</li><li>€250/hour per Master Videographer, €200/hour per Associate Videographer and €100/hour per videographer assistant.</li><li><strong>Q: If we cancel the photoshoot/video-shoot , will we receive our booking fee back?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Unfortunately no. Booking fees are used to reserve your date. Once we’ve reserved your date, we do not accept new clients for your date.</li><li><strong>Q: If we change our photoshoot/video-shoot&nbsp; to a different date, will we be able to use our booking fee towards a future date?</strong></li><hr><li>A: Generally no, but this is taken on a case by case basis. The reason for canceling and our availability is taken into account. Also, if rates change from your original date to your new date, the new rates will apply.</li><li><strong>Q: Are there travel fees included in the price of a photoshoot/video-shoot?</strong></li><hr><li>A: All travel expenses are based on the distance between your event location(s).</li><li><strong>Q: Why do you charge travel fees?</strong></li><hr><li>The primary purpose is to provide adequate compensation for our photographers, videographers and our lighting assistants for the additional time spent in travel. Trips to Paphos, for example, can take over an hour each way. This is time for which we have to compensate our team. For this reason, coupled with the costs of reimbursing the team for the actual costs of travel, these fees are unfortunately necessary.</li>
